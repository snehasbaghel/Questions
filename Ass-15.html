            <p>Communication between two people or two devices needs to follow some protocol. A
                protocol is a set of rules that governs communication. For example, in a face-to-face
                communication between two persons, there is a set of implicit rules in each culture that
                define how two persons should start the communication. Similarly, in a telephone conversation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col" style="background-color: #e6e6e6;">
            <p>There is a rule how to make connection (dialing
                the telephone number), how to respond to the call (picking up the receiver), how to
                greet, how to let the communication flow smoothly by listening when the other party is
                talking, and finally how to end the communication (hanging up). Similarly, in a telephone conversation, there
                are a set of rules that we need to follow.</p>
